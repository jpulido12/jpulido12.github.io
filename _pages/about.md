I was born and raised on the beautiful island of [Saipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saipan) in the Northern Mariana Islands. Now, I'm at Providence College studying Computer Science & Psychology

Broadly, I'm interested in language, learning, and attention. How is information/input (such as language) that we retrieve from the natural world encoded in our minds? How does the brain/mind allow us to learn from the world? I intend on exploring these questions and more utilizing methods from cognitive and computational neuroscience.
