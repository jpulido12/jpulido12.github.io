I was born and raised on the beautiful island of [Saipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saipan) in the Northern Mariana Islands. Currently, I'm at Brown as a lab manager/RA studying cognitive control. I plan to apply to PhD programs in Cognitive Science, Psychology, or Neuroscience. 

My goal is to lead a research program as a principal investigator and professor and training the next generation of scientists. My research interests include cognitive flexibility, language, and learning. I am passionate about open science, teaching, mentoring, and social justice. 

Outside research, I enjoy making and eating food, makeup and fashion, swimming, reading, exploring nature, dancing with friends, and watching series like Game of Thrones.
