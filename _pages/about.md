I was born and raised on the beautiful island of [Saipan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saipan) in the Northern Mariana Islands. Now, I'm at Providence College studying Computer Science & Psychology.

I aim to be a computational cognitive neuroscientist. I'm interested in language, decision-making, and learning. How do biological machines like humans store information and utilize this knowledge to make decisions? How do cogntive deficits influence how humans learn and make decisions? I plan on exploring these questions and more utilizing methods from psychology,neuroscience, computer science, and linguistics.

I am passionate about open science, teaching, mentoring, and social justice. 

Outside research, I enjoy trying new restaurants, poker, swimming, reading, exploring nature, dancing with friends, and watching series like Game of Thrones and Supernatural.
